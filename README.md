## Introduction

The News Data Analysis Pipeline is a comprehensive project that aims to extract valuable insights from a global news dataset. By leveraging a wide range of data science techniques, including MLOps, time-series analysis, machine learning, and network analysis, the project provides a robust framework for understanding the dynamics and trends within the news ecosystem.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of news articles collected from various global media sources using the NewsAPI. The dataset includes information such as article metadata, content, sentiment, and source details. Additionally, the project utilizes complementary datasets, including domain location data and global website traffic data, to enrich the analysis.

## Key Features

### MLOps Components

The project incorporates several MLOps components to ensure the scalability, maintainability, and reliability of the news data analysis pipeline. These include a feature store, model versioning, and model monitoring.

### Analysis Pipeline Design

The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to design an end-to-end analysis pipeline, covering data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, and monitoring.

### Time Series Analysis

The project performs in-depth time-series analysis on the news data, including trend and seasonality identification, anomaly detection, and forecasting of key metrics.

### News Headline Classification

A machine learning model is developed to classify news headlines into predefined categories, enabling the identification of the main topics and focus areas covered by different news sources.

### Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis

Topic modelling and sentiment analysis techniques are applied to the news content to extract deeper insights, understand thematic trends, and monitor the emotional tone of news coverage.

### Predictive Analysis and Modelling

Predictive models are built to forecast relevant metrics, such as the global ranking of news websites, sentiment of news articles, and traffic trends, providing forward-looking insights to support decision-making.

### Network Analysis

Network analysis is conducted to unveil the relationships and connections within the news ecosystem, including news source interactions, geographic coverage patterns, and topic interdependencies.

## Installation and Usage

To use the News Data Analysis Pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-data-analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare the data by downloading the necessary files and updating the file paths in the `config.py` module.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and execute the various analysis tasks.
5. Customize and extend the Python modules in the `src/` directory to add new functionality or refine the existing components.
6. Integrate the trained models and analysis components into your production environment, leveraging the MLOps features described earlier.

For more detailed instructions and usage examples, please refer to the README.md file in the project repository.
