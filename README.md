# Task 2: Data Science Components and Machine Learning

## Overview
In this task, we focus on building various data science components and implementing machine learning techniques to extract deeper insights from the news dataset.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement MLOps components, including a feature store, model versioning, and model monitoring.
- Design an end-to-end analysis pipeline using the CRISP-DM methodology.
- Perform time-series analysis on the news data to identify trends and patterns.
- Develop a machine learning model to classify news headlines into predefined categories.
- Apply topic modeling and sentiment analysis to the news content.
- Build predictive models to forecast relevant metrics, such as website rankings and traffic trends.
- Conduct network analysis to unveil the relationships and connections within the news ecosystem.

## Steps

1. **Implement MLOps Components**:
   - Set up a feature store to manage and version the data features used for modeling.
   - Implement model versioning using a tool like MLflow to track and manage trained models.
   - Integrate model monitoring to detect data drift and performance degradation over time.

2. **Design the Analysis Pipeline**:
   - Follow the CRISP-DM methodology to design an end-to-end data analysis pipeline.
   - Incorporate data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and deployment stages.

3. **Perform Time-series Analysis**:
   - Analyze the temporal trends and patterns in the news data, including topic and sentiment evolution over time.
   - Identify seasonality, anomalies, and other time-dependent characteristics.
   - Use time-series forecasting techniques to predict future news metrics.

4. **Classify News Headlines**:
   - Develop a machine learning model to categorize news headlines into predefined topics, such as politics, business, technology, and sports.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and iterate on the feature engineering and model selection.

5. **Apply Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use techniques like LDA and BERTopic to extract the main topics covered in the news articles.
   - Analyze the sentiment distribution across news sources and topics, comparing the impact of using mean/median and examining the overall sentiment trends.

6. **Build Predictive Models**:
   - Develop regression and classification models to forecast metrics like website global ranking, traffic trends, and sentiment scores.
   - Explore the relationships between news reporting, sentiment, and website performance.

7. **Conduct Network Analysis**:
   - Investigate the network of news sources, examining the connections, influence, and information flow within the ecosystem.
   - Identify central and influential news outlets, as well as clusters of news sources covering similar topics.

## Deliverables
- Code implementations for the various data science components and machine learning models.
- A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, findings, and insights from Task 2.
- Visualizations and dashboards showcasing the analysis results.

## Next Steps
After completing Task 2, you will proceed to Task 3, which focuses on integrating the data pipeline with a PostgreSQL database.
